Advent of Code 2020 in R

See how I (try to) do the 2020 Advent of Code challenge in R. Advent of code is a programming challenge that runs each year. See [https://adventofcode.com/](Advent of Code) for more details.

If you have done one of the days that I haven't been able to do, please feel free to submit a pull request!
